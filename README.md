This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First you need to run `yarn install` or `yarn` to install all the dependencies.

You need to set the env variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file, you can copy and paste the `.env.example` file.

If you don't have `API_KEY` you can create one in the [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) webpage

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
